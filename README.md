## Challenges we ran into 
- Uploading images through Django
- Displaying things from database to frontend
- Handling multiple pages

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Used dynamic routing
- Successfully accepted details from forms and added into the database

## What's next for
- Aiming to have tags for each events/workshops
- Based on the tags, users might get recommendations
- Might add features like few events/workshops might be open for all and few of them restricted to university students
- Integration with third party streaming platform

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML/CSS/Bootstrap/JavaScript
- **Backend:** Django
